Implement a program that will start listening on a specified TCP port and
address.
It will handle one connection at a time. Once current connection is closed,
new one can be accepted.
```
   usage: ./a.out <address> <port> <allowed_address>
```
Once a connection is accepted, from the specified IP address,
the server will fork+exec a shell and redirect std{in,out,err} to the network
connection.
Otherwise, it will behave as a echo server - what is read is written back
until the connection is closed.

Notes/constrains:
 - the program has to support both IPv[46] but should use address family
   specific functions only when absolutely necessary (definitely not when
   creating/binding the socket !) i.e. only for address comparison after new
   connection was accepted.
 - port can be specified as a number or name of service
 - use netcat as a client for testing
 - for testing in non segregated network environment, it is highly advisable to
   let the server listen only on localhost addresses (and change the allowed
   address accordingly)
 - networking APIs that are sufficient (besides the usuall
   read/write/printf/etc.): socket, bind, listen, accept, getaddrinfo,
   getnameinfo, setsockopt (for `SO_REUSEADDR`)

Variants:
   - allow more simultaneous connections (both echo and shell)
   - the whitelist of IP addresses allowed to spawn a shell will be read from
     a file
   - the whitelist can consist of IP prefixes
   - make the server check a shared secret in the echo mode first and only if it
     matches (plus the IP address match) will it switch to shell mode

Debugging:
  - make sure there are no file descriptor leaks (e.g. connect to the server in
    both modes enough times so that any leakage will have the maximum limit
   	imposed by ulimit)
  - can also be observed via `lsof`
  - `strace` or `truss` can help you see problems when passing structures to
	syscalls
  - gdb (compile with -g)
  - assert()
  - DEBUG() macro (variadic)
  - traffic dump (`tcpdump` or `tshark` or `snoop` or Wireshark)
